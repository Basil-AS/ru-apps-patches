/**
 * Neutralizes two MAX background WorkManager jobs identified in
 * apps/ru.oneme.app/analysis/habr_audit_findings.md:
 *   - C.3 `SampleUploadWorker`: uploads diagnostic sample files to `sdk-api.apptracer.ru`
 *     (OK/VK Tracer SDK).
 *   - C.2 `DailyAnalyticsWorker`: daily collects and reports the status of 7 Android
 *     permissions (push/contacts/files/gallery/camera/microphone/geo) as a `PERMISSION`
 *     analytics event.
 *
 * Earlier investigation (see JOURNAL.md 2026-10-06) considered nop-ing the
 * `WorkManager.enqueue` call site instead (found at `t8n.smali:1609` for
 * SampleUploadWorker), but that requires tracing which of several enqueue call sites in
 * a large method belongs to which worker — fragile across app versions. Patching each
 * worker's own `doWork()` override directly is simpler and more robust: both are
 * `androidx.work.Worker` subclasses overriding `doWork()` with a single zero-arg method
 * returning the (obfuscated) `Result` sealed type — see WorkerFingerprints.kt for why the
 * fingerprint doesn't hardcode that type's name.
 *
 * `Result` has exactly 3 concrete subclasses at runtime (mirroring
 * `androidx.work.ListenableWorker.Result`'s Success/Failure/Retry): one has only a bare
 * no-arg constructor (Retry - never carries data), the other two additionally have a
 * `(Data)`-arg constructor and a data getter (Success/Failure - both may carry output
 * data). We must NOT construct the no-arg-only one: returning Retry from `doWork()`
 * tells WorkManager to reschedule the job, which would just re-run this same patched
 * stub forever (a harmless but wasteful infinite retry loop). Returning either of the
 * two data-carrying variants is safe regardless of which one is "really" Success vs
 * Failure: both are terminal states for a `OneTimeWorkRequest` (no automatic retry), so
 * telling them apart further isn't necessary for this patch's purpose.
